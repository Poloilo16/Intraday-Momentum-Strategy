## Strategy Assessment

- Strategy successfully identifies trend breakouts
- Risk management through daily exits
- Clear entry/exit rules

### Weaknesses
- **Low Win Rate**: Only 22.2% of trades were profitable
- **Negative Expected Value**: Average loss of $53.26 per trade
- **Long Bias**: Strategy tends to go long more often, which hurt performance during the test period
- **Late Entries**: Bounds might be too close to current price, causing late entries after moves have already started
- **No Stop Loss**: Trades can accumulate large losses before daily exit

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Optimize Bound Calculations**: Current bounds may be too tight, causing false signals
2. **Add Stop Loss**: Implement intraday stop losses to limit downside risk
3. **Position Sizing**: Consider volatility-adjusted position sizing
4. **Signal Filtering**: Add filters to reduce false breakout signals
5. **Market Regime Detection**: Adjust strategy based on market conditions (trending vs. range-bound)
6. **Commission Optimization**: Consider trade frequency vs. transaction costs

## Conclusion
The current bounds trading strategy showed a **slight negative performance (-0.48%)** over the 12-day test period. While the strategy successfully identified several breakout opportunities, the **low win rate (22.2%)** and **negative expected value** suggest that the bounds calculation or entry/exit logic needs refinement.

The strategy may work better in different market conditions or with optimized parameters. Further testing across longer time periods and different market regimes is recommended before live implementation.
